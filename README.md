# Coopefy
Website that allows people to collaborate building cool stuff on the internet 


# **What is DevDAO's Coopefy?** (name can be changed)
The innovators who created the internet had a clear goal in mind: release the untapped potential of the world via collaboration regardless of geographical constraints, skin color, or academic background. As long as you had the talent and the willingness to pursue something of value alongside like-minded people, the internet could become the place to achieve your wildest dreams. 

The goal was achieved over time, but partially. 

Now, the internet allows anyone to connect with fellow dreamers from any part of the globe. To collaborate on projects and ideas. And to change the world in the process (or at least try).
    
 The internet, however, is still nowhere near what these first innovators had in mind. 
 
 Collaboration is possible, but an arduous job. Tools are expensive, opportunities are not easy to come by as expected, and people are often wary to collaborate with others given the lack of safety and incentive's alignment.
 
 DevDAO's Coopefy makes it possible to change that - allowing people from anywhere to collaborate on anything as long as incentives align.  
 
# **How Does Coopefy Make it Happen?**

Harnessing the power of tokenomics (decentralization and no constraints), we allow people to collaborate with each other by promoting better incentive alignment and safety in two ways:

- Those who need help can share their project's demands, offering a reward for a successful job. 

- Those who want to help can apply their knowledge and skills on these projects in exchange for the reward. 

## **Safety**
Every reward goes through a smart contract that works as an arbitrator. Help-seekers can deposit the rewards safely on project creation, and collaborators can expect the reward to reach their wallet on successful delivery.
No manual intermediary, just code. 

## **Incentives**
If you're an indie creator, DAO member, entrepreneur, or hiring executive looking for talented people to collaborate on your project/company/ideas, you can find exactly that kind of collaborator here.
If you're a talented person in search of an opportunity to collaborate and be rewarded for output, you can find exactly that kind of opportunity here.
