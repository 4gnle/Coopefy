# **What is DevDAO's Coopefy?** (name can be changed)
The innovators who created the internet had a clear goal in mind: release the untapped potential of the world via collaboration regardless of geographical constraints, skin color, or academic background. As long as you had the talent and the willingness to pursue something of value alongside like-minded people, the internet could become the place to achieve your wildest dreams. 

The goal was achieved over time, but partially. 

Now, the internet allows anyone to connect with fellow dreamers from any part of the globe. To collaborate on projects and ideas. And to change the world in the process (or at least try).
    
 The internet, however, is still nowhere near what these first innovators had in mind. 
 
 Collaboration is possible, but an arduous job. Tools are expensive, opportunities are not easy to come by as expected, and people are often wary to collaborate with others given the lack of safety and incentive's alignment.
 
 DevDAO's Coopefy makes it possible to change that - allowing people from anywhere to collaborate on anything as long as incentives align.  
 
# **How Does Coopefy Make it Happen?**

Harnessing the power of tokenomics (decentralization and no constraints), we allow people to collaborate with each other by promoting better incentive alignment and safety in two ways:

- Those who need help can share their project's demands, offering a reward for a successful job. Those who want to help can apply their knowledge and skills on these projects in exchange for the reward. 

- A smart contract takes over the reward distribution, making sure the help-seeker can receive quality work for their money, and the collaborator receives the reward as long as their work meets the standards.
